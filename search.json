    "text": "BeromEnglish\n\n\nKya ha re beta ha tik sɔng\n\n\nFire has consumed rocks, leaving the grass unharmed.\n\n\n\nThis proverb is used when a well-known hero or champion is unexpectedly defeated by an unknown or insignificant opponent in a contest.\nA good way to understand this is by recalling the biblical story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17). In the story, David, a mere shepherd boy, defeats Goliath, the mighty Philistine warrior. Similarly, when a celebrated figure loses to an underdog in a game, fight, or competition, they often struggle to openly admit their defeat.\nInstead, the defeated hero and their supporters might describe the outcome using the phrase:\n“Kya ha re beta ha tik sɔng.”\nThis expression reflects their reluctance to acknowledge the unexpected loss.\nEdited by Ricky Macharm."

The organization began in 1973 when SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistic) assigned Ms Hanni Kuhn who came from Switzerland to work with the Berom in writing the Language in a modern way, to also write or translate books in the Language. When the work began they started with the translation of the Bible, followed with other literatures."
