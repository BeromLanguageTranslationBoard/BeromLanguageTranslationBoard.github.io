    "text": "BeromEnglish\n\n\nKya ha re beta ha tik sɔng\n\n\nFire has consumed rocks, leaving the grass unharmed.\n\n\n\nThis proverb is used when a well-known hero or champion is unexpectedly defeated by an unknown or insignificant opponent in a contest.\nA good way to understand this is by recalling the biblical story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17). In the story, David, a mere shepherd boy, defeats Goliath, the mighty Philistine warrior. Similarly, when a celebrated figure loses to an underdog in a game, fight, or competition, they often struggle to openly admit their defeat.\nInstead, the defeated hero and their supporters might describe the outcome using the phrase:\n“Kya ha re beta ha tik sɔng.”\nThis expression reflects their reluctance to acknowledge the unexpected loss.\nEdited by Ricky Macharm."

    "text": "BeromEnglish\n\n\nHwɔs sam, hywɛp gwom.\n\n\nA slave during the rainy (planting) season; a king at harvest.\n\n\n\nThe proverb teaches that hard work leads to great rewards. It compares farming to life’s endeavors: during planting season, one must work diligently like a servant, but at harvest time, one enjoys abundance like royalty. This wisdom applies to any investment of time, money, or effort. Initially, you must toil without immediate results, but persistence leads to significant rewards. This concept mirrors the English saying “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” When someone hesitates to make an investment—like a parent worried about school fees—this proverb offers encouragement that initial sacrifice leads to valuable returns."

The militias, arriving in large numbers, began shooting sporadically. They moved from house to house, killing residents and setting homes ablaze. Some victims were gunned down while attempting to flee, as the entire village had already been surrounded.\nWhen asked whether there were any security personnel nearby, villagers said that a security checkpoint was located just 200 to 500 meters from Bindi. However, no help came during the attack. When questioned, the security personnel claimed that the militias had blocked their access route into the village, preventing any intervention.\nThe assault claimed the lives of 27 people, many of whom were women, children, and the elderly. The mass burial was held on Friday, July 25, 2025, under tight security and amid heightened tension. The event was attended by the state governor and his entourage, several politicians, traditional rulers, and a massive crowd of mourners."

For this reason a seminar is being organized for the Reverends/Pastors to start with as God’s servants.\nWe organized a seminar for the minister of God so that they can start preaching in their churches in Berom language. This will encourage their members to follow suit on the use of the Berom Bible.\nTherefore we began the seminar with Ropp zone which comprises of Fan, Ropp and Gashish on the May 11, 2025. Though the turn out was not that encouraging in view of the happenings at that zone on that day.\nWe went to Gyel zone for the seminar which comprises of Vwang, Kuru, Gyel, Du and Zang on June 12, 2025. We were elated with the massive turnout of the ministers of God. The turnout comprises of Reverends/Pastors that are none Berom speaking. They were amazed with the teaching because most of them feel lazy to use the Berom Bible on account of the difficulty to read it but the way we taught them really encouraged them. What surprised us the most was their resolve to plead with us to step down the teaching to their denominations/RCCs. This was really an encouragement to us.\nWe are waiting for the Foron zone which comprises of Bakin Kogi, Foron, Heipang, Rim, Bachit, Hoss to give us a day and date to go for their own seminar.\nWe shall continue to update you on the activity and progress of the work."
