Each of them cultivated the land very well, but Mr. Monkey’s corn looked better and greener than Mr. Hare’s because he applied enough manure.  Mr. Hare saw that Mr. Monkey’s corn was much better than his own, so he went to Mr. Monkey’s house and deceived him. He said to him, ‘The King announced that everyone must cut down the corn in their farm tomorrow. Anyone who does not cut his corn will be arrested, and if care is not taken, he will be put in prison for being stubborn.’  Mr. Monkey got up very early in the morning, took his machete, and went to the farm. He started cutting the corn until he had finished the whole farm.  After some time, Mr. Monkey discovered that Mr. Hare did not cut his own corn. He said to himself, ‘Oh, so Mr. Hare deceived me! Okay, that’s alright, we shall see!’  Mr. Monkey left and went to buy clothes, shoes, two boxes, caps, and other things, and he filled those two boxes with the items. Then he dug a hole and buried the two boxes. He returned home and told his father and mother, “Go and hide inside the room so that Mr. Hare will not see you.” Then he went to Mr. Hare’s house. He met him at home and said to him, “Come and support me in mourning my father and mother who have died.”  Mr. Hare followed him to his house, and they went straight to the place where he had buried the boxes. He climbed on top and started crying:  Father, oh father, Oh give me your blessings. Mother, oh mother, Oh give me your blessings.  Father, oh father, Oh give me your blessings. Mother, oh mother, Oh give me your blessings.  When he had finished the mourning song, he dug up the grave, removed the boxes, and opened them. Mr. Hare saw plenty of clothes inside. He said to Mr. Monkey, “Are these the blessings that your father and mother gave you?” And he replied, “Yes.”  Mr. Hare ran to his house and met his father and mother taking porridge. He said to his mother, “Mother, you people should stop taking that porridge so I can kill you and get blessings.” His mother said to him, “Ya kukuuk! You will kill us? What have we done?”  Mr. Hare took a pestle and hit his mother ‘pok’, and she fell ‘kalas’ and died. He hit his father ‘pok’, and he fell ‘kalas’ and died also. He carried the corpses, dug a grave, and buried them.  After that, he went to call Mr. Monkey and said to him, “Come and support me in mourning my father and mother who have died.” So they went to the place where Mr. Hare had buried his father and mother. He climbed on top of the place and started crying:  Father, oh father, Give me your blessings. Mother, oh mother, Give me your blessings.  Father, oh father, Give me your blessings. Mother, oh mother, Give me your blessings.  He dug up the grave and saw the teeth of his father and mother ‘ngeeey’! He closed the grave and started crying again. He tried to dig, but still saw the same thing; there was nothing else.  After that, he went to Mr. Monkey’s house. He met Mr. Monkey’s father and mother alive at home. Mr. Hare said to Mr. Monkey, “So you deceived me?”  Mr. Monkey said to Mr. Hare, “You first deceived me into cutting down my corn farm completely. That was why I deceived you too.”  Mr. Hare left for his house. On reaching home, he committed suicide out of anger and died.  That’s the end."

In the story, David, a mere shepherd boy, defeats Goliath, the mighty Philistine warrior. Similarly, when a celebrated figure loses to an underdog in a game, fight, or competition, they often struggle to openly admit their defeat.\nInstead, the defeated hero and their supporters might describe the outcome using the phrase:\n“Kya ha re beta ha tik sɔng.”\nThis expression reflects their reluctance to acknowledge the unexpected loss.\nEdited by Ricky Macharm."

The militias, arriving in large numbers, began shooting sporadically. They moved from house to house, killing residents and setting homes ablaze. Some victims were gunned down while attempting to flee, as the entire village had already been surrounded.\nWhen asked whether there were any security personnel nearby, villagers said that a security checkpoint was located just 200 to 500 meters from Bindi. However, no help came during the attack. When questioned, the security personnel claimed that the militias had blocked their access route into the village, preventing any intervention.\nThe assault claimed the lives of 27 people, many of whom were women, children, and the elderly. The mass burial was held on Friday, July 25, 2025, under tight security and amid heightened tension. The event was attended by the state governor and his entourage, several politicians, traditional rulers, and a massive crowd of mourners."

For this reason a seminar is being organized for the Reverends/Pastors to start with as God’s servants.\nWe organized a seminar for the minister of God so that they can start preaching in their churches in Berom language. This will encourage their members to follow suit on the use of the Berom Bible.\nTherefore we began the seminar with Ropp zone which comprises of Fan, Ropp and Gashish on the May 11, 2025. Though the turn out was not that encouraging in view of the happenings at that zone on that day.\nWe went to Gyel zone for the seminar which comprises of Vwang, Kuru, Gyel, Du and Zang on June 12, 2025. We were elated with the massive turnout of the ministers of God. The turnout comprises of Reverends/Pastors that are none Berom speaking. They were amazed with the teaching because most of them feel lazy to use the Berom Bible on account of the difficulty to read it but the way we taught them really encouraged them. What surprised us the most was their resolve to plead with us to step down the teaching to their denominations/RCCs. This was really an encouragement to us.\nWe are waiting for the Foron zone which comprises of Bakin Kogi, Foron, Heipang, Rim, Bachit, Hoss to give us a day and date to go for their own seminar.\nWe shall continue to update you on the activity and progress of the work."

    "text": "BeromEnglish\n\n\nHwɔs sam, hywɛp gwom.\n\n\nA slave during the rainy (planting) season; a king at harvest.\n\n\n\nThe proverb teaches that hard work leads to great rewards. It compares farming to life’s endeavors: during planting season, one must work diligently like a servant, but at harvest time, one enjoys abundance like royalty. This wisdom applies to any investment of time, money, or effort. Initially, you must toil without immediate results, but persistence leads to significant rewards. This concept mirrors the English saying “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” When someone hesitates to make an investment—like a parent worried about school fees—this proverb offers encouragement that initial sacrifice leads to valuable returns."
