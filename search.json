The organization began in 1973 when SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistic) assigned Ms Hanni Kuhn who came from Switzerland to work with the Berom in writing the Language in a modern way, to also write or translate books in the Language. When the work began they started with the translation of the Bible, followed with other literatures."
