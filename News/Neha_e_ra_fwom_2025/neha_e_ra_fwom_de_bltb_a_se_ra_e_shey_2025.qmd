### REPORT ON THE WORK OF BLTB IN 2025

BLTB is trying this year to see that the Berom are reading the Berom Bible. For this reason a seminar is being organized for the Reverends/Pastors to start with as God's servants.

We organized a seminar for the minister of God so that they can start preaching in their churches in Berom language. This will encourage their members to follow suit on the use of the Berom Bible.

Therefore we began the seminar with Ropp zone which comprises of Fan, Ropp and Gashish on the May 11, 2025. Though the turn out was not that encouraging in view of the happenings at that zone on that day.

We went to Gyel zone for the seminar which comprises of Vwang, Kuru, Gyel, Du and Zang on June 12, 2025. We were elated with the massive turnout of the ministers of God. The turnout comprises of Reverends/Pastors that are none Berom speaking. They were amazed with the teaching because most of them feel lazy to use the Berom Bible on account of the difficulty to read it but the way we taught them really encouraged them. What surprised us the most was their resolve to plead with us to step down the teaching to their denominations/RCCs. This was really an encouragement to us.

We are waiting for the Foron zone which comprises of Bakin Kogi, Foron, Heipang, Rim, Bachit, Hoss to give us a day and date to go for their own seminar.

We shall continue to update you on the activity and progress of the work.
