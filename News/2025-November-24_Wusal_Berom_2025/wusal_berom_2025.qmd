### BEROM INTERDENOMINATIONAL SERVICE 2025

The Berom Interdenominational Service 2025 was held on 9/11/2025. People came out in large numbers to attend the service. The preacher was Rev. Gyang Kala of the New Life Gospel Church for All Nations, and the service leader was Rev. Pam Markus of ECWA DCC Gwol. He took his reading from Acts 18:1-4. Topic: "The true worshipper of God and his handiwork." 

The service was good and people came out to worship God. It was not only the Berom but other tribes too. Prayers were offered for Nigeria, Plateau State, the Gbong Gwom Jos and the traditional council in Berom Land, the Governor of Plateau State, and all Berom at home and in the diaspora. 

Prayers were offered as the Audio Bible in Berom, both Old and New Testament, was dedicated on that day. We thank God for the success of the dedication. The Central Planning Committee of Wusal Berom 2025 went out to solicit support for the Wusal preparation and people supported by giving generously. Two of our sons gave us three (3) caterpillars that graded and leveled the field. The Committee also invited an architect who designed everything we need to build on the field. People were very happy and appreciated all that has been done. We are hopeful that if we get some finances, we will start something there. The Governor made a pledge of N100m Naira and we pray that it will be redeemed. This is the summary of what happened at Wusal Berom 2025.
