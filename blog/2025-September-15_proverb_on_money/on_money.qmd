If you are fond of criticizing people and doing nothing to improve the person being criticized, for example, the way a person spends his money, the way he/she cooks, the way the person dresses, etc. In defence, the person being criticized will reply the critic:

*"Vu na dyam mɛ ka a simo a re beving ke bekup."*
