### THE STORY OF MR. HARE AND MR. MONKEY

<br>
When the rainy season arrived, Mr. Hare and Mr. Monkey each planted corn on his own farm.<br>
Each of them cultivated the land very well, but Mr. Monkey's corn looked better and greener than Mr. Hare's because he applied enough manure.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hare saw that Mr. Monkey's corn was much better than his own, so he went to Mr. Monkey's house and deceived him.<br>
He said to him, 'The King announced that everyone must cut down the corn in their farm tomorrow.<br>
Anyone who does not cut his corn will be arrested, and if care is not taken, he will be put in prison for being stubborn.'<br>
<br>
Mr. Monkey got up very early in the morning, took his machete, and went to the farm.<br>
He started cutting the corn until he had finished the whole farm.<br>
<br>
After some time, Mr. Monkey discovered that Mr. Hare did not cut his own corn.<br>
He said to himself, 'Oh, so Mr. Hare deceived me! Okay, that's alright, we shall see!'<br>
<br>
Mr. Monkey left and went to buy clothes, shoes, two boxes, caps, and other things, and he filled those two boxes with the items.<br>
Then he dug a hole and buried the two boxes.<br>
He returned home and told his father and mother, "Go and hide inside the room so that Mr. Hare will not see you."<br>
Then he went to Mr. Hare's house.<br>
He met him at home and said to him, "Come and support me in mourning my father and mother who have died."<br>
<br>
Mr. Hare followed him to his house, and they went straight to the place where he had buried the boxes.<br>
He climbed on top and started crying:<br>
<br>
Father, oh father,<br>
Oh give me your blessings.<br>
Mother, oh mother,<br>
Oh give me your blessings.<br>
<br>
Father, oh father,<br>
Oh give me your blessings.<br>
Mother, oh mother,<br>
Oh give me your blessings.<br>
<br>
When he had finished the mourning song, he dug up the grave, removed the boxes, and opened them.<br>
Mr. Hare saw plenty of clothes inside.<br>
He said to Mr. Monkey, "Are these the blessings that your father and mother gave you?"<br>
And he replied, "Yes."<br>
<br>
Mr. Hare ran to his house and met his father and mother taking porridge.<br>
He said to his mother, "Mother, you people should stop taking that porridge so I can kill you and get blessings."<br>
His mother said to him, "Ya kukuuk! You will kill us? What have we done?"<br>
<br>
Mr. Hare took a pestle and hit his mother 'pok', and she fell 'kalas' and died.<br>
He hit his father 'pok', and he fell 'kalas' and died also.<br>
He carried the corpses, dug a grave, and buried them.<br>
<br>
After that, he went to call Mr. Monkey and said to him, "Come and support me in mourning my father and mother who have died."<br>
So they went to the place where Mr. Hare had buried his father and mother.<br>
He climbed on top of the place and started crying:<br>
<br>
Father, oh father,<br>
Give me your blessings.<br>
Mother, oh mother,<br>
Give me your blessings.<br>
<br>
Father, oh father,<br>
Give me your blessings.<br>
Mother, oh mother,<br>
Give me your blessings.<br>
<br>
He dug up the grave and saw the teeth of his father and mother 'ngeeey'!<br>
He closed the grave and started crying again.<br>
He tried to dig, but still saw the same thing; there was nothing else.<br>
<br>
After that, he went to Mr. Monkey's house.<br>
He met Mr. Monkey's father and mother alive at home.<br>
Mr. Hare said to Mr. Monkey, "So you deceived me?"<br>
<br>
Mr. Monkey said to Mr. Hare, "You first deceived me into cutting down my corn farm completely.<br>
That was why I deceived you too."<br>
<br>
Mr. Hare left for his house.<br>
On reaching home, he committed suicide out of anger and died.<br>
<br>
That's the end.
