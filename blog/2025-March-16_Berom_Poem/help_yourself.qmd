### SƐLƐ RATO MO
Dagwi a yong kayɛ pyɛ 
Ko a hala pyɛ cak wɛt
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo

Jey ya se tolot
Kye hywɛ
Weneng ha se horos
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo

Gwi gwa ro shara negbey
Pwɛl gwa ro ra sede hwey
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo

Hwa ra a yɛn narang
Ba jut wɛt
Hwa yang ɛn shou
Ba toyo a ho wɛt
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo

Sangal jey ha sɛ sede
Re vat e nazɛng
Be niri zɔng
Ko be yong vɛ
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo

Nejwang ná toyo e lo rwas mɛ wɛt
Njɛm na rongol e gwad sa rwas mɛ
Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo
A gwa hom
sɛlɛ rato mo


### HELP YOURSELF    
God created everything
And He hasn't let go of anything 
Do what you can now
O my brother/sister
Help yourself 

The world is slippery
Take it easy
Marriage is single
Do what you can now 
O my brother/sister
Help yourself 

The sun is still shining 
The moon is still acting like a child 
Do what you can now 
O my brother/sister
Help yourself 

You called them on the phone 
They didn't pick up 
You said hello 
They didn't answer you 
Do what you can now 
O my brother/sister
Help yourself 

Life on earth is like 
Eating the vat plant in the dry season 
It takes only patience to fix it
Do what you can now 
O my brother/sister 
Help yourself 

Adultery has not returned to her husband's house 
Concubine is still in her husband's friend's bed
Do what you can now 
O my brother/sister 
Help yourself
