Jey ya se tolot <br>

Nejwang ná toyo e lo rwas mɛ wɛt <br>

Ra pyɛ de hwo tɔk ra a remo <br>
A gwa hom <br>

### HELP YOURSELF    
God created everything <br>
And He hasn't let go of anything <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>

The world is slippery <br>
Take it easy <br>
Marriage is single <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>

The sun is still shining <br>
The moon is still acting like a child <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>

You called them on the phone <br>
They didn't pick up <br>
You said hello <br>
They didn't answer you <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>

Life on earth is like <br>
Eating the vat plant in the dry season <br>
It takes only patience to fix it <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>

Adultery has not returned to her husband's house <br>
Concubine is still in her husband's friend's bed <br>
Do what you can now <br>
O my brother/sister <br>
Help yourself <br>
