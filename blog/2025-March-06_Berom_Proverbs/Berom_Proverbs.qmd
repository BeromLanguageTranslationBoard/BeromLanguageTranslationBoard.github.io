### Berom    
Kya ha re beta ha tik sɔng


### English    
Fire has consumed rocks, leaving the grass unharmed.
::::


This proverb is used when a well-known hero or champion is unexpectedly defeated by an unknown or insignificant opponent in a contest.  

A good way to understand this is by recalling the biblical story of **David and Goliath** (1 Samuel 17). In the story, David, a mere shepherd boy, defeats Goliath, the mighty Philistine warrior. Similarly, when a celebrated figure loses to an underdog in a game, fight, or competition, they often struggle to openly admit their defeat.  

Instead, the defeated hero and their supporters might describe the outcome using the phrase:  

**"Kya ha re beta ha tik sɔng."**  

This expression reflects their reluctance to acknowledge the unexpected loss.
