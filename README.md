# README: Berom Language Contribution Platform

## Introduction
Visit our website: [Berom Language Contribution Platform](https://beromlanguagetranslationboard.github.io/)
This website is built to encourage contributions from Berom sons and daughters living in Jos, Nigeria, its surroundings, and across the world. Our goal is to create a growing repository of Berom-language text resources, transforming Berom from a low-resourced language into a moderately resourced one and beyond.

## Why This Matters
Many African languages, including Berom, lack sufficient written materials to support learning, research, and digital tools like automatic translation, speech recognition, and literacy programs. By building a rich collection of Berom texts, we empower future generations to engage with their language in education, technology, and daily life.

## Call to Action
Small steps, big impact—one paragraph at a time.

Help preserve and promote the Berom language by writing just one paragraph (50–150 words) per week! Every word you contribute strengthens our language, making it more accessible for future generations and digital tools.

We invite every Berom speaker to contribute at least **one paragraph per week** in Berom. Your contribution can take any form:
- **A diary entry**: Write about your day in Berom.
- **A devotional**: Share an inspiring religious message.
- **News**: Report on events in your community.
- **Poetry**: Express yourself through Berom poetry.
- **Stories and traditions**: Share meaningful cultural narratives.
- **Opinions**: Discuss relevant topics in Berom.

Every paragraph counts in strengthening the language and ensuring its survival in the digital age.

## How to Contribute
1. **Write** a short paragraph in Berom—it can be about daily life, stories, traditions, opinions, or anything meaningful to you.
2. **Email it** to berom.language@gmail.com.
3. **Spread the word** and invite others to join!

## Future Goals
- Expand the project to include **audio recordings** for pronunciation guides.
- Develop **digital tools** like Berom spell checkers and translation services.
- Publish a **Berom digital library** accessible worldwide.

One paragraph per week. One language stronger. Will you take the challenge?

Together, we can ensure that Berom thrives as a written and spoken language for generations to come!
